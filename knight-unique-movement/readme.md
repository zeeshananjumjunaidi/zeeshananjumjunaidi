## Introduction
The chess knight has a unique movement, it may move two squares vertically and one square horizontally, or two squares horizontally and one square vertically (with both forming the shape
of an L).

## Rules
- Only cells containing a character are considered valid.
- You are allowed to place the knight valid cell initially and then you should perform `n - 1` jumps to build the string. The character of the cell you placed the knight in, is also part of the
resulting string.
- A valid knight jump is not allowed to start or end on an non valid cell.
- All jumps should be valid knight jumps.
- The characters/cells that the knight jumps over during a jump are not part of the string
produced.
- The resulting string cannot contain more than two vowels.
